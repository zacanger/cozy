# Docstrings use single quotes
# They don't show up when you print functions, but do
# show up using the global `doc()` function.
let id = fn (a) {
    'id is the identity function';
    a;
};

# global function prints docstring
print(id);
print(doc(id));

# these would be a syntax error; docstrings can _only_
# appear as the first statement in functions
# print(type('asdf'));
# print('asdf');
