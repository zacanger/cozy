# TODO

v1 work:
* Errors and exceptions: As values? Try/catch? Stack traces?
* At least 50% code coverage
* Confirm that everything under ./examples works
* Complete all lingering TODOs in the code
* Add argument validation to all internal functions and stdlib
* Improve all error messages
* Remove other extraneous things from readline fork
* Docstrings cause parsing errors, fix that

v2 work:
* Move as much of the stdlib into cozy (out of Go) as possible
* More real-world examples (twitter clone, todo app, better shell)
* Cryptography builtins
* Multiple-db ORM
