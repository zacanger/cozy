# TODO

List of things to get done before a v1.
* Major things missing:
    * HTTP server and client
    * Concurrency
    * Cryptography builtins
    * Proper errors/exceptions
    * Try/catch (or treat errors as values, don't throw them)
    * At least 50% code coverage
* Minor things:
    * Add argument validation to all functions
    * Improve all error messages
    * Add tab completion and arrow support to the REPL
    * Flesh out the testing library with functions to test failure and errors
    * Remove parens in `if`, `while`, and `for`
    * Remove `self`?
    * Cozy, memo, and other FP utils
