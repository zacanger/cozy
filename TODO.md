# TODO

List of things to get done before a v1.

* Major things missing:
    * Cryptography builtins
    * Errors and exceptions: As values? Try/catch? Stack traces?
    * Dot access only works at one level at a time
* Minor things:
    * At least 50% code coverage
    * Confirm that everything under ./examples works
    * Complete all lingering TODOs in the code
    * Add argument validation to all internal functions and stdlib
    * Improve all error messages
    * Remove other extraneous things from readline fork
